            <p>
                In the process of losing weight and staying fit, women often end up making mistakes like eating too less,<br>
                not working out as per their body type and expecting instant results.<br>
                It is essential to concentrate on having a balanced diet comprising all the nutrients,<br>
                and compliment it with regular workouts by making exercise a fun activity rather than a boring task.
                Here's a fitness guide for the new-age women who are too caught up with their work, having no time for fitness:

            </p>
            <h1>1. Healthy Breakfast- a must!</h1>
            <p>
                A healthy breakfast with the inclusion of fiber and glucose is imperative to retain energy for the entire day. Out of all the three-time meals,<br>
                breakfast is the most important one which should be light, healthy and nutritious.
            </p>
            <h1>2. Replace junk food with healthy snacking</h1>
            <p>
                The very first rule of maintaining a fit body is to remove unhealthy junk and oily food from their daily routine as it will affect your exercise routine and immune system. So switching to healthy snacking rich in protein, calcium, fats, carbs, <br>
                minerals, and fiber will help in maintaining weight and reducing the risk of several diseases.
            </p>
            <h1>3. Follow a structured exercise pattern</h1>
            <p>
                One should prepare a structured exercise pattern to be followed daily with simple exercises like walking, <br>
                running to tone the body. It is advised that women should exercise for at least three hours in a week to reach their fitness goal.

            </p>
            <h1>4. Keep your body hydrated</h1>
            <p>
                When we exercise we lose a lot of sweat for which water is the best source that revives the body with immense energy for the day.<br>
                Drinking water in regular intervals will help you avoid dehydration leading to a healthier you
            </p>
            <h1>5. cut out the carbs.</h1>
            <p>
                Women should avoid refined carb-rich foods like cookies, chocolates, honey and white rice as they spike your blood sugar level, produce more insulin and increase the amount of fat in your body. <br>
                Therefore the daily diet should extensively be rich in protein, calcium, and vitamins.

      <h1> Feminine health</h1>
      <p>
  The vagina is designed to keep itself clean with the help of natural secretions (discharge). Find out how to help your vagina keep clean and healthy, and why you don't need douches or vaginal wipes.
  The vagina is a tube of muscle inside a woman's body that runs from the cervix (the opening of the womb) to the vaginal opening.
  The external sex organs, which are called the vulva, surround the vaginal opening.
      </P>
      <p>
looking after your everyday health can help keep your vagina in good shape, says Dr Suzy Elneil, consultant in urogynaecology at University College Hospital, London, and spokesperson for Wellbeing of Women.
"Generally, good vaginal health is maintained by making sure you're in good general health," she explains. "This includes a healthy diet and exercise.
"Normal exercise helps maintain good vaginal function, as walking and running helps the pelvic floor to tone up and ensure good general health."

              Maintaining a healthy vulva and vagina will help prevent infections and discomfort. Unusual changes in vaginal discharge is a sign that there might be an issue.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is vulva and vagina care important?</h2>
            <p>
              Many women experience uncomfortable, vaginal infections (vaginitis) at one time or another. The area around the entrance to the vagina (vulva) can also become irritated. Steps can be taken to relieve and prevent vulvar discomfort and vaginal infections.

Not all vaginal infections are alike and home treatments can worsen some types. If you have any concerns about your vulvar or vaginal health, or notice unusual changes in vaginal discharge, contact your healthcare provider if the problem persists.

            <h2 class="titleText"><span>B</span>ody types</h2>
            <p>
              People are born with an inherited body type based on skeletal frame and body composition. Most people are unique combinations of the three body types: ectomorph, mesomorph, and endomorph.
            </p>
            <h2>Ectomorphs</h2>
            <p>
              Are long and lean, with little body fat, and little muscle. They have a hard time gaining weight. Fashion models and basketball players fit this category. While most of us love to hate these genetically-blessed individuals, some male ectomorphs may not be thrilled with their narrow-chested frames, and some female ectomorphs long for more womanly curves.
            </p>
            <h2>Endomorphs</h2>
            <p>
               Have lots of body fat, lots of muscle, and gain weight easily. "Football lineman tend to be endomorphs -- they're heavier and rounder individuals," says Colby. "And they don't have to necessarily be overweight. Both Oprah Winfrey and Marilyn Monroe are classic examples of endomorphs."
            </p>
            <h2>Mesomorphs</h2>
            <p>
            Are athletic, solid, and strong. "They're not overweight and not underweight," says Colby, "and they can eat what they want without worrying too much about it." They both gain and lose weight without too much effort.

      <h1> Fitness tips</h1>
      <p>
  xercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc., but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Or, you can jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure you're not in severe pain during your workout. Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity workout. It may be irritating, but that means your body is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each workout. The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding.
      </P>
      <p>
Keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical exercising. Ever wonder why body builders' body masses are so big? That's because they plan out their meals and take in more (healthy) calories than the average person. On the other hand, losing weight and striving for a skinnier physique will involve more physical exercise than calories you ingest.

            <h2 class="titleText"><span>G</span>irly tips</h2>
            <p>Finding the perfect fitting bra starts with knowing your correct size. According to research,
              as many as 75% of women wear the wrong size bra. And if you wear a plus size bra, it can be even harder to find a bra that fits.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 1: Determine your band size</h2>
            <p>While braless or wearing a non-padded bra, use a measuring tape to measure around your torso directly under your bust, where a bra band would sit. The tape should be level and very snug. Round to the nearest whole number. If the number is even, add four inches. If it’s odd, add five. Your band size is the sum of this calculation.
              (So if you measured 32 inches, your band size is 36. If you measured 33 inches, your band size is 38.)
            </p>
            <h2>Step 2: Take your bust measurement</h2>
            <p>Wrap the measuring tape somewhat loosely
              around the fullest part of your chest (at nipple level). Round to the nearest whole number.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 3: Calculate your cup size</h2>
            <p>Subtract your calculated band size (Step 1) from your bust measurement (Step 2) and refer to the bra cup size chart here.
              Your bra size is your band size with your cup size. Example: 37 inches (bust) – 34 inches (band) = 3 inches. That’s a 34C.

            <h2 class="titleText">Menstruation</h2>
            <p>The menstrual cycle is the series of changes a woman's body goes through to prepare for a possible pregnancy. About once a month, the uterus grows a new, thick lining. This lining is then ready to receive a fertilized egg. The egg becomes fertilized if it joins with a man's sperm and implants in the lining of the uterus. This is how pregnancy begins. When there is no fertilized egg, the uterus sheds its lining. This is the monthly menstrual bleeding, or period. Women have periods from their early teen years until menopause, around age 50.
            </p>
            <h2>How can you care for yourself at home?</h2>
            <h1>To relieve menstrual cramps</h1>
            <p>
Put a warm water bottle or a warm cloth on your belly. Or use a heating pad set on low. Heat improves blood flow and may relieve pain.
To relieve back pressure, lie down and put a pillow under your knees. Or lie on your side and bring your knees up to your chest.
Get regular exercise. It improves blood flow, which may decrease pain.
Use pads instead of tampons if you have pain in your vagina.
Take anti-inflammatory medicines to reduce pain. These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). Be safe with medicines. Read and follow all instructions on the label. Start taking the recommended dose when symptoms begin or one day before your menstrual period starts.
If you are trying to become pregnant, talk to your doctor before you use any medicine.

            <h2 class="titleText">Postpartum care</h2>
            <p>The postpartum period refers to the first six weeks after childbirth. This is a joyous time, but it’s also a period of adjustment and healing for mothers.
               During these weeks, you’ll bond with your baby and you’ll have a post-delivery checkup with your doctor.
            </p>
            <h2>Adjusting to motherhood</h2>
            <h1>1. Get plenty of rest.</h1>
            <p>
                Get as much sleep as possible to cope with tiredness and fatigue. Your baby may wake up every two to three hours for feeding.
                To make sure you’re getting enough rest, sleep when your baby sleeps.
            </p>
            <h1>2. Seek help.</h1>
            <p>
                Don’t hesitate to accept help from family and friends during the postpartum period, as well as after this period. Your body needs to heal, and practical help around the home can help you get much-needed rest.
                 Friends or family can prepare meals, run errands, or help care for other children in the home.
            </p>
            <h1>3. Eat healthy meals.</h1>
            <p>
                GMaintain a healthy diet to promote healing. Increase your intake of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and protein.
                You should also increase your fluid intake, especially if you are breast-feeding.
            </p>
            <h1>4. Exercise. </h1>
            <p>
              Your doctor will let you know when it’s OK to exercise. The activity should not be strenuous.
              Try taking a walk near your house. The change of scenery is refreshing and can increase your energy level.
